Zangle 
Designed and developed by Andrew Breckenridge 

Zangle allows you to access your Mistar gradebook on your iOS device, no longer do you have to go through clunky browser interface to see how you're doing in school 

The app is currently enabled for the Novi School District, other school districts will be added in future versions. 

If you are interested in helping with the design or development of future versions, please contact the development team at asbreckenridge@me.com.
